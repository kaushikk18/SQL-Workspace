## WORLD CORONA DATA ANALYSIS

The main aim of the project is to analyze and gain insights into how the world got affected during the pandemic. 

I started the project with two separate csv files. One consists of the death data and the other consists of vaccination data.

The data was collected from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

First I cleaned the data in both the tables by removing empty columns and columns which had no use.

A few of the explorations done with SQL on this data are:
- What percentage of the population got COVID?: Determined the percentage of the population that contracted COVID-19
- Total Cases Vs Populations: Explored the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19 in different locations
- Countries with the highest death count per population: Identified countries with the highest death count per population.
- Total death percentage: Calculated the total death percentage based on COVID-19 data.
- and many more

Learnings from the project:
- How to face errors while importing a huge dataset into the SQL server.
- I learned how to work with aggregate funtions.
- Learned how to create views and use window functions.
- Learned how to use CTE and Temporary tables.


Through the utilization of SQL, this project successfully explored and analyzed COVID-19 data. The objectives were met by gathering and cleaning the data, processing it using SQL queries, and answering key questions related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population percentages. The project highlighted the significance of data exploration and demonstrated the effectiveness of SQL for extracting valuable insights from large datasets.
